# This is a Sudoku Game

## I've built the template with: npx create-react-app sudoku-app --template typescript

## I came across an issue with jest where I had to update to the latest version. I was able to solve this with the help of AI. 

## This application has only one sudoku problem and one solution which are hardcoded due to time constraints. It checks if the solution the user enters is equal to the solution. If it is, the app will respond to the user with "Correct!". And if not, then it will ask the user to try again.

## Make sure to cd sudoku-app to run it with npm start.
